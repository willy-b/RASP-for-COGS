We also ask that you please cite https://github.com/willy-b/RASP-for-COGS
and/or an associated scientific publication
(e.g. the RASP-for-ReCOGS paper https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15349 which
also announces this work until there is a separate paper with full RASP-for-COGS
results in which case that should be cited instead).
Thanks for reading!
