# THIS IS SEPARATE FROM RASP-for-ReCOGS which was solved earlier, separately, see https://github.com/willy-b/learning-rasp/blob/main/word-level-pos-tokens-recogs-style-decoder-loop.rasp and the draft paper for the ReCOGS solution at https://raw.githubusercontent.com/willy-b/RASP-for-ReCOGS/main/rasp-for-recogs_pos-wbruns-2024-draft.pdf .

# A solution for the "COGS: A Compositional Generalization Challenge Based on Semantic Interpretation"
# (Kim and Linzen 2020, https://aclanthology.org/2020.emnlp-main.731 ) task is being worked on here.

# To try this out, run `python cogs_examples_in_rasp.py`!

# Note, it is simpler and more performant to just train a Transformer on examples!
# This is an academic exercise, writing a neural network compatible program by hand in the Restricted Access Sequence Processing (compilable to Transformer) language (Weiss et al 2021, https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.06981 )
# to prove a Transformer can perform a particular type of solution (a systematic and compositional solution, unrolling recursive grammar using the decoder loop).

# See cogs_examples_in_rasp.py for a way to run this. Alteratively use the RASP interpreter REPL to run it line by line and see the output.

# We want to show a Transformer can solve the structural generalization splits of the "COGS: A Compositional Generalization Challenge Based on Semantic Interpretation"
# (Kim and Linzen 2020, https://aclanthology.org/2020.emnlp-main.731 ) task (though this is written without reference to that material based on train.tsv and we won't know how it does on those until the end).

# (We made use of the convenient summary of Kim, Linzen's COGS task grammar and vocab made by IBM's CPG project (their utilities, not their CPG project itself) at https://github.com/IBM/cpg/blob/c3626b4e03bfc681be2c2a5b23da0b48abe6f570/src/model/cogs_data.py#L523 )

# See also our finished RASP solution to the semantically equivalent ReCOGS task (Wu et al 2023, "ReCOGS: How Incidental Details of a Logical Form Overshadow an Evaluation of Semantic Interpretation", linked from the  draft paper at https://raw.githubusercontent.com/willy-b/RASP-for-ReCOGS/main/rasp-for-recogs_pos-wbruns-2024-draft.pdf ).

# explanation of sequence values for part of speech and verb type:
# det: 1
# pp: 2
# was: 3
# by: 4
# to: 5
# that: 6:
# common_noun: 7
# proper_noun: 8
# v_trans_omissible: 9
# v_trans_omissible_pp: 10
# v_trans_not_omissible: 11
# v_trans_not_omissible_pp: 12
# v_cp_taking: 13
# v_inf_taking: 14
# v_unacc: 15
# v_unerg: 16
# v_inf: 17
# v_dat: 18
# v_dat_pp: 19
# v_unacc_pp: 20
# v_normalized_in_output: 21

# we are using these values with 1d embeddings for simplicity
# we could also use 1 hot vectors of dimension 21 and then it is easier to see how checking for equality is easy with vector dot product
# (and saying e.g. common_noun or proper_noun could be dot product with sum of 1-hot 21d vectors for (common_noun + proper_noun))
# but we keep it simple for human reading here and use these scalars in 1d as is easily supported by RASP.
